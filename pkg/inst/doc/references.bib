  abstract = {SUMMARY: The assessment of data quality is a major concern in microarray
	analysis. arrayQualityMetrics is a Bioconductor package that provides
	a report with diagnostic plots for one or two colour microarray data.
	The quality metrics assess reproducibility, identify apparent outlier
	arrays and compute measures of signal-to-noise ratio. The tool handles
	most current microarray technologies and is amenable to use in automated
	analysis pipelines or for automatic report generation, as well as
	for use by individuals. The diagnosis of quality remains, in principle,
	a context-dependent judgement, but our tool provides powerful, automated,
	objective and comprehensive instruments on which to base a decision.
	AVAILABILITY: arrayQualityMetrics is a free and open source package,
	under LGPL license, available from the Bioconductor project at www.bioconductor.org.
	A users guide and examples are provided with the package. Some examples
	of HTML reports generated by arrayQualityMetrics can be found at
	http://www.microarray-quality.org},

  journal = {Biostatistics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {118--127},
  number = {1},
  month = {Jan},
  abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly
	observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often
	rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult.
	The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers
	to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from
	studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in
	studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general,
	it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
	effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
	data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes
	( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies
	are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are
	not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical
	Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust
	to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing
	methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example
	data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply,
	and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available
	at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.},
